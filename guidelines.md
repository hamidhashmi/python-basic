# Guidelines

These are the guidelines to write python scripts for given problems. This is WIP, we will keep on updating this Guidelines page over the period of time.

## MR Guidelines

```Make sure you fork the repository and raise a pull request to upstream repository.```

* Before raising MR, You must follow the proper directory structure to add your solution. Here is the sample directory structure.
```
Example: 
    Topic -> Solutions -> YourName -> assignment_01.py
    Topic -> Solutions -> YourName -> assignment_02.py
```

* MR Naming Guidelines
```
MR Name: [Branch Name][Action] Comment

Example: Suppose, You are adding some functionality the title should be-
    [Master][Add] Added function to read input from user
```

## Coding Guidelines
* Try to put comments in your code.
* Try to use functions in your code.
* Make sure your code have 5+ pylint rating.

## Code must work on below versions of Python:
* Python 3.x
